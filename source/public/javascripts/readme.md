NAMESPACING RULES:
-window.app = {} is our global namespace
-each slice has it's own js file, work in your slice's :)
-within your file, follow the global name structure of putting it into app.YourSlice.Models.ModelName and same goes for the Collections/Views. See the first few lines of each file for the navbar direction
-when you use the constructor of a class in the router, be sure when you do "new" you are using the namespaced object
-if you need to add a route, be sure to follow the "navigateTo" protocol
-routes are already added
